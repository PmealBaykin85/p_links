## Week1 - History

### The History of Writing and Number Systems 
1. Cave paintings and a tally written on a bone

2. Volatile memory vs non-volatile memory (RAM vs HDD/SSD)
3. Number representation (signed, unsigned, factorial)
4. Text representation (ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange, control codes)
5. File types (text and binary)

### Number Systems and Conversions
- Binary (base 2)
- Decimal (base 10)
- Octal (base 8)
- Hexadecimal (base 16)


## Week3 - Structure of Text

1. Early/modern text structures (anchient texts with commentary, newspapers, JSON)
