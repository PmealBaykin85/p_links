## Week1 - History

### The History of Writing and Number Systems 
1. Cave paintings and a tally written on a bone
2. Clay tablets (Mesopotamia) and Cuneiform
3. Babalonian numerials (numbers to 59, the base 60 system)
4. Egyptian (symbols for powers or 10) and Roman (subtractive notation)
5. Sumerian Language (used syllabic writing)
6. Gilgamesh the EPIC
7. Miltilingual inscriptions (old Persian, Elamite, Babalonian)

### Development of Printing
- Cylinder seals (Mesopotamia; for stamping)
- Woodblock printing (old wooden block dated 868 AD)
- Movable type enabled rearranging characters to create different texts (Gutengurg Press; Gutengurd Bible)
- Impact printing (reduced book prices and facilitated a cultural renaissance and reformation)

### Modern Writing Systems
1. The development of alphabets (Phoenician, Chinese, Mesoamerican, etc.)
2. Writing input devices and standards (typewriters and keyboards)
3. Key terminologies include:
- Typeface: Design of letters
- Font: Collection of typefaces
- Serif/Sans Serif: Fonts with/without decorative strokes
- Uppercase/Lowercase: Originated from physical storage cases


## Week2 - Representing Text and Numbers in Computers

### How Computers Represent Text and Numbers in Memory
1. Binary system (1, 0; base 2)
2. Volatile memory vs non-volatile memory (RAM vs HDD/SSD)
3. Number representation (signed, unsigned, factorial)
4. Text representation (ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange, control codes)
5. File types (text and binary)

### Number Systems and Conversions
- Binary (base 2)
- Decimal (base 10)
- Octal (base 8)
- Hexadecimal (base 16)


## Week3 - Structure of Text 

### Text Structure
1. Early/modern text structures (anchient texts with commentary, newspapers, JSON)
2. Markup Languages (Markdown, HTML)

### Special Characters and Escaping
- Nonalphanumeric symbols (@, #, &, $, etc.)
- Escaping in markdown (\\# to show # on your page)
- HTML escaping (&lt for <, &gt for >, &amp for &)

### Structured Data
1. JSON ({"key": "value"})
2. XML (\<tag>value\</tag>

### Tools and Platforms
- GitHub

### Unicode
1. Similar to ASCII (allows for much larger numbers and characters)
2. Unicode codepoints (vs ASCII codes)
3. UTF-23 (uses 4 bytes to store codepoints. Waste of space since most bytes end up being filler with '0s'
4. UTF-8 (same as ASCII but uses multiple bytes for codepoints above 127. Most popular)

### Browsers
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Search engines (Google, Bing, etc.)


## Week4 - Manipulating Text & Text Editors

### Keyboards
1. Standard 104-key layout
2. Split, vertical, and ortholinear varients
3. Layouts (QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak)
4. Modifier Keys (Ctrl, Shift, Alt, etc.)
5. Touch typing (typing without looking at the keyboard)

## Word Processors and Text Editors
- Word processors (Microsoft Word)
- Text editors (Vim, Visual Studio Code)
- IDEs: Integrated Development Environments (WebStoorm, Pycharm)

### Search Techniques
1. Basic Search (Ctrl + F for finding text)
Advanced Search (Wildcards use * for any character sequence; Regex [regular expressions] for pattern matching)

### GitHub Pages
- Host webpages
- Use customizable themes

## Week5 - Command Line Interfaces

### CLI - Command Line Interface
1. Originated from teletype machines connected to computers (commands were printed on paper and later replaced by screens)
2. CLI has many advantages (easy automation via scripting, minimal resource usage on computer, remote work)
3. Basic commands (ls, cd, pwd, cat, less, cp, mv, mkdir, ping, etc.)
4. Advanced commands (grep, redirection and piping)

### Remote Access and Security
- SSH (secure shell)
- File transfer (scp, sfcp)
- Interactive tools (htop, tmux)
- Integration (Linux on Windows; use tools alogside Windows applications)
